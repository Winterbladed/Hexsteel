Rat Souls is a single player 3D third person souls-like action-adventure game, but Rats, developed for Windows PC with the Unity Engine using a very low-poly boxy design.
You are a wandering someone who happened to stumble on a deserted town. The Rats have mutated into more "combat-efficient" forms to drive out the humans.
